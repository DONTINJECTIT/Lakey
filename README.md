If you enjoy this hub please make sure to star it, thank you.

# About the scripts within the hub

Certain scripts in the hub might require a key. To know if a key is required click the 3 dots on the right and you will be told if a key is required. if a key is required for the script will have a discord link, or a LV link. 

Other scripts will not have a key, so discript for the script it will tell you how to toggle it on and off.
